    "details": "Meghan Markle's Nelson Mandela story continues to unravel after the only South African cast member of 'The Lion King' said he was \"baffled\" by her suggestion that he told her his country had \"rejoiced\" when she married Prince Harry. The former Suits actress recalled an encounter she had at the 2019 London premiere of 'The Lion King' with an actor from South Africa who made a comparison to her wedding with Prince Harry and Nelson Mandela. “He looked at me, and he’s just like light. He said, ‘I just need you to know: When you married into this family, we rejoiced in the streets the same we did when Mandela was freed from prison,’” she said during an interview with The Cut. The Daily Mail revealed Dr John Kani, who claims he was the only South African actor in the film, said he did not attend the premiere and had never met the Duchess of Sussex. \"I have never met Meghan Markle,\" he told the MailOnline. \"This seems like something of a faux pas by her. I have I have never met the duchess at all. I am the only South African member of the cast and I did not attend the premiere in London. \"The only South African was me playing Rafiki. But I did not go to the opening in Leicester Square as I didn't have the time to do that. It just may be a mis-remembering on her side. \"It is baffling me.\" Nelson Mandela’s grandson said he was “surprised” when he heard Ms Markle compare her wedding with Prince Harry to his grandfather being freed from prison. He said it “cannot be equated to as the same\". The Duchess of Sussex was met with heavy criticism online after she told the story to The Cut. \"The damage her and her husband are doing to the Queen and the Royal Family is incalculable... these two hypocritical, self-obsessed liars are in the end going to be ignored,\" said Nigel Farage"

    "details": "On Thursday night’s episode of Up Late, Ben Harvey has suggested Troy Mercanti start an OnlyFans account if he wishes to challenge anti-consorting laws. The notorious bikie will fight allegations that he broke WA’s stringent anti-consorting and insignia laws — but is also watching a High Court challenge to the regulations which the State Government have touted have the nation’s toughest against outlaw motorcycle gang members. The long-time one per center was not in court on Wednesday when the not guilty pleas were entered. WATCH UP LATE IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE But his lawyer Paul Holmes was, who revealed that Mercanti’s defence will be on two fronts — against elements of the alleged offence, and the legislation itself. Mercanti was charged with the two offences outside an Italian restaurant in front of shocked onlookers earlier this year. According to eyewitnesses, Mercanti — dressed in a T-shirt and shorts — was having lunch with long-time friend John Kizon at Mt Hawthorn’s Lupo Lab when more than a dozen officers from the gang crime squad descended and asked him to step outside. Soon afterwards, he was told he was being charged via summons with displaying gang insignia, which was prohibited under sweeping laws that came into effect a few months ago. Earlier the same week, Mercanti was hit with a dispersal notice by police while picking up a friend at the airport. Mercanti’s case was adjourned until October to be allocated a trial date. On Up Late, Harvey warned fighting in court may get expensive for Mercanti, and suggested a way he may be able to come up with the cash. Harvey may have gotten the idea after it was this week revealed that Dhakota Williams — the 21-year-old daughter of slain underworld king Carl Williams started an OnlyFans account. “If it’s good enough for the wife and daughter of slain gangland boss Carl Williams then it’s gotta be good enough for Troy Mercanti,” Harvey says. “See Troy’s OnlyFans page for exclusive tips for how a modern outlaw can best accessorise… find out why black and white are the only colours you need in your wardrobe… a showcase of latest leather trends… tips on keeping healthy. “And exclusively for OnlyFans subscribers... an inside look at the man who put the soft into soft serve, how he relaxes listing to 80s glam-rock and some cosplay as a Lego spaceman.”"
